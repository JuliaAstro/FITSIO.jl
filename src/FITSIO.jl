# FITS
#
# The FITS type represents a FITS file. It holds a reference to a
# FITSFile object (basically the low-level CFITSIO pointer). It also
# holds a reference to all of the previously accessed HDU
# objects. This is so that only a single HDU object is created for
# each extension in the file. It also allows a FITS object to tell
# previously created HDUs about events that happen to the file, such
# as deleting extensions. This could be done by, e.g., setting ext=-1
# in the HDU object.
"""
    FITS(filename::String, mode::String="r")

Open or create a FITS file. `mode` can be one of `"r"` (read-only),
`"r+"` (read-write) or `"w"` (write). In "write" mode, any existing
file of the same name is overwritten.

A `FITS` object is a collection of "Header-Data Units" (HDUs) and
supports the following operations:

* `f[i]`: Return the `i`-th HDU.

* `f[name]` or `f[name, ver]`: Return the HDU containing the given the
  given EXTNAME (or HDUNAME) keyword (a String), and optionally the
  given EXTVER (or HDUVER) number (an Integer).

* Iteration:
  ```
  for hdu in f
      ...
  end
  ```

    FITSHeader(keys::Vector{String}, values::Vector, comments::Vector{String})

An in-memory representation of the header of an HDU. It stores the
(key, value, comment) information for each 80-character "card" in a header.

Note that this structure is not linked to a FITS file in any way; it
is just a convenient structure for storing the header contents after
reading from a file. (This is similar to how an `Array` returned by
`read(f[1])` is not linked to the FITS file `f`.)  Manipulating a
`FITSHeader` will therefore have no immediate impact on any file, even
if it was created by `read_header(::HDU)`.  You can, however, write a
`FITSHeader` to a file using the `write(::FITS, ...)` methods that
append a new HDU to a file.
